# Algorithmic-Programming
This repository contains my solutions to many coding problems and algorithm implementations from various websites, such as USACO, CodeForces, and LeetCode

## Algorithms and Techniques Used to Solve the Problems
- Graph traversal (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra) to find shortest and most optimal paths
- Recursion
- Binary Search
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal & Prim's Algorithms) to find problems involving the minimum cost of doing something
- Prefix Sums & Binary Indexed Trees to quickly calculate sums of specific ranges (1D/2D) given by input queries
- Using Advanced Data Structures (Maps, Sets, Queues, Stacks, LinkedLists, Trees)
- Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up, Top-Down)
- Bitmasking 
- String manipulations and processing
- Ad Hoc
